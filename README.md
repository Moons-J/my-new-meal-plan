<h2>Hello and welcome to the MyNewMealPlan README file. 🤓</h2>
<h6>👋 I'm Jonas, the pitcher of this idea.</h6>

<h4>🏁 Goal of this web app:</h4>
With just a little bit of the users personal information like, height, weight, birthday, etc...
This web app will give them a persice calculation of their nutrition facts.
But the main feitures of our web app are:
<ul>
  <li>Personal ingredients list, where the user can add, delete and update their ingredients.</li>
  <li>A meal creation page where the nutritions of that meal are automaticaly calculated.</li>
  <li>A daily plan creation page, where created meals can be assigned to a time.</li>
</ul>

<h4>👴 Origin:</h4>
My original idea started when I wanted to lose weight.
But I did't now where to start... So, I did some googeling and I created a lot of excel files...
witht hese files I made a completely automated personal diet machine and I wanted to go further but I reached my limits with Excel.
