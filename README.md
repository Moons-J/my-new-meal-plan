<h2>Hello and welcome to the MyNewMealPlan README file. 🤓</h2>
<h6>👋 I'm Jonas, the pitcher of this idea.</h6>

<h4>🏁 Goal of this web app:</h4>
With just a little bit of the users personal information like, height, weight, birthday, etc...
This web app will give them a precise calculation of their nutrition facts.
The main features of our web app are:
<ul>
  <li>Personal ingredients list, where the user can add, delete and update their ingredients.</li>
  <li>A meal creation page where the nutritions of that meal are automatically calculated by ingredients added.</li>
  <li>A daily plan creation page, where created meals can be assigned to a time.</li>
  <li>These daily plans can then be assigned to a day of the week.</li>
  <li>By assigning plans to your agenda, the shopping list will show you which ingredients you should get from the store.</li>
</ul>

<h4>👴 Origin:</h4>
My original idea started when I wanted to lose weight.
But I did't now where to start... So, I did some googling and I created a lot of excel files...
with these files I made a completely automated personal diet machine and I wanted to go further but I reached my limits with Excel.
